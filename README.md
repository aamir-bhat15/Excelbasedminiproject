# This is Excel based mini project
First sheet is the raw data.

Second sheet where I did handson regarding data cleaning and data handling.

Third sheet is the pivot table of few basic information/insights I need from the data.

Forth is the final sheet, i.e., dashboard. In this I have created visualise based on pivot table, with help of these visualise we can get the insights quickly.
